# 🌐 Cloud-Based CI/CD Project  

## 🚀 Excited to Share My Recent Project!  

I recently had the opportunity to work on a **cloud-based CI/CD project** where I leveraged:  

- **Amazon EC2** and **GitHub Actions self-hosted runners** for building a scalable infrastructure.  
- **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)** for containerized image management.  
- **Azure Container Registry (ACR)** to store and manage Docker images.  
- **Azure Web App** to deploy and host applications with high availability.  

## 📌 Key Highlights  

✅ Automated CI/CD pipelines with **GitHub Actions** for seamless integration and delivery.  
✅ Worked with **Docker** for containerization, ensuring applications are portable and efficient.  
✅ Implemented **multi-cloud deployment strategies**, utilizing both **AWS** and **Azure** for optimized workflows.
